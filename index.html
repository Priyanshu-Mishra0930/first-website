        Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.

        Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Beginning with Python 3.5, capabilities and keywords for typing were added to language, allowing optional static typing. Currently only versions in the 3.x series are supported.

        Python has gained widespread use in the machine learning community. It is widely taught as an introductory programming language. Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten of the most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index, which ranks based on searches in 24 platforms.

        <p id="p2">WHY??&nbsp;PYTHON!!</p>
        <p id="p1">Python is a powerful, versatile, and beginner-friendly programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), allowing developers to structure code efficiently using classes and objects. One of Python’s biggest strengths is its vast collection of libraries such as NumPy for numerical computation, Pandas for data analysis, 
            Matplotlib for visualization, Flask and Django for web development, and TensorFlow for machine learning. Being cross-platform, Python runs smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a universal choice for developers. Its dynamically typed nature and automatic memory management reduce the complexity of coding, letting programmers focus more on logic and creativity. Python’s 
            open-source nature and strong global community ensure continuous growth and endless learning opportunities. From web development and automation to artificial intelligence, data science, and even game creation — Python can do it all, making it one of the most widely used and loved programming languages in the world.
